To use the application, first simply download your course schedule as a PDF from <a href="my.utk.edu">MyUTK</a>. Once you have it on your computer, spin up the application, and drag the PDF over from your desktop to the drop area. If it's not on your desktop, you can use the built in file browser by selecting ```Semester +```. It will then confirm that it recieved your schedule.

To push it to your preferred calendar, toggle the dropdown menu, and select either ```.ics file``` or ```Google```. Google will promt you to login and authorize the application. The other just creates a general ICS file that you can use with most digital calendars.
