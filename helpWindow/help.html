        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> 
            The purpose of this app is to allow a student to upload their
            course schedule (in pdf format) which can be found from the MyUTK page
            and allow them to take an ICS file, and upload it to a calendar
            application of their choice
        </p>
        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>
            The user has a couple of choices in regards to how they want to upload a file, such as:
            <ul class="choices">
                <li>Selecting the sidebar option "Semester +" and using the file explorer to find their pdf</li>
                <li>Dragging and dropping the desired pdf into the central region of the app</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <h3>ICS File Creation</h3>
        <p>
            If the user selects to upload their PDF information to an ICS file, an ICS file will be created
            and downloaded to the user.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessing MyUTK</h3>
        <p>
            If the user decides to open MyUTK using the app to download their course schedule, upon downloading
            their schedule it will be saved as a .aspx file (this has only been tested on windows thus far). Thus,
            the user can simply right click on the .aspx file and rename the extension with .pdf to change it to a PDF
            file.
        </p>
        <h3>Downloading Additional Dates</h3>
        <p>
            If the user would like to add additional dates from the UTK academic calendar, they can download an ICS file
            through our app by pressing the "Additional Dates" button. This will direct the user to UT's website where
            they can download the appropriate ICS file by following the instructions on the page.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating an Event</h3>
        <p>
            By selecting the "Create events" button the user will able to create events via an ICS file in addition to
            their schedules. The use case in mind for this would be to add events such as exams to their calendars through
            our app. Once the button is clicked, the user is brought to another page where they can fill out the proper
            fields in order to create the event.
        </p>
        <h3>Lighten Up</h3>
        <p>
            By selecting the "Lighten Up" button the user can change the color scheme of the app to fit a lighter aesthetic.
